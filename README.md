# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, this is Matt Davis. 

I began seriously studying the world of coding at the beginning of 2022. 

The concept was intriguing to me for a while before that, and I am really glad to have taken the plunge. 

## What Do I Know? 

- A bit about Java and Spring Boot as a backend RESTful server
- A bit about React as a front-end
- I will never know enough
- CSS is a love/hate (I think I love, but am still afraid)
- No one *knows* RegEx, and those who do are demigods
