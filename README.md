- 👋 Hi, I’m @emkeidi. When not learning to code, I write and also offer services as a gig worker. 
- 👀 It's high time to learn about software engineering
- 🌱 This page is me learning in public
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on kindness (once I've got some chops)
- 👶 If you're experienced, this profile might look silly. If you're also new, don't worry about looking silly!
